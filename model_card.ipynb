       "'# **Model Details**\\n\\nMeta developed and released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\\n\\n**Model Developers** Meta\\n\\n**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\\n\\n**Input** Models input text only.\\n\\n**Output** Models generate text only.\\n\\n**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\\n\\n||Training Data|Params|Context Length|GQA|Tokens|LR|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\nLlama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|7B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>\\nLlama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|13B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>\\nLlama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|70B|4k|&#10004;|2.0T|1.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>\\n\\n**Llama 2 family of models.** Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. The 70B version uses Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\\n\\n**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\\n\\n**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\\n\\n**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\\n\\n**Research Paper** More information can be found in the paper \"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\", available at https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/.\\n\\n**Where to send questions or comments about the model** Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the model [README](README.md).\\n\\n# **Intended Use**\\n**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\\n\\n**Out-of-scope** Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 2 Community License. Use in languages other than English**. \\n\\n**Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 2 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 2 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\\n\\n# **Hardware and Software**\\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta\\'s Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\\n\\n**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\\n\\n||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO<sub>2</sub>eq)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|\\n|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|\\n|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|\\n|Total|3311616||539.00|\\n\\n**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta\\'s sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\\n\\n# **Training Data**\\n**Overview** Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\\n\\n**Data Freshness** The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\\n\\n# **Evaluation Results**\\n\\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.\\nFor all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\\n\\n|Model|Size|Code|Commonsense Reasoning|World Knowledge|Reading Comprehension|Math|MMLU|BBH|AGI Eval|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Llama 1|7B|14.1|60.8|46.2|58.5|6.95|35.1|30.3|23.9|\\n|Llama 1|13B|18.9|66.1|52.6|62.3|10.9|46.9|37.0|33.9|\\n|Llama 1|33B|26.0|70.0|58.4|67.6|21.4|57.8|39.8|41.7|\\n|Llama 1|65B|30.7|70.7|60.5|68.6|30.8|63.4|43.5|47.6|\\n|Llama 2|7B|16.8|63.9|48.9|61.3|14.6|45.3|32.6|29.3|\\n|Llama 2|13B|24.5|66.9|55.4|65.8|28.7|54.8|39.4|39.1|\\n|Llama 2|70B|**37.5**|**71.9**|**63.6**|**69.4**|**35.2**|**68.9**|**51.2**|**54.2**|\\n\\n**Overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks.** *Code:* We report the average pass@1 scores of our models on HumanEval and MBPP. *Commonsense Reasoning:* We report the average of PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA, and CommonsenseQA. We report 7-shot results for CommonSenseQA and 0-shot results for all other benchmarks. *World Knowledge:* We evaluate the 5-shot performance on NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA and report the average. *Reading Comprehension:* For reading comprehension, we report the 0-shot average on SQuAD, QuAC, and BoolQ. *MATH:* We report the average of the GSM8K (8 shot) and MATH (4 shot) benchmarks at the top 1.\\n\\n|||TruthfulQA|Toxigen|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Llama 1|7B|27.42|23.00|\\n|Llama 1|13B|41.74|23.08|\\n|Llama 1|33B|44.19|22.57|\\n|Llama 1|65B|48.71|21.77|\\n|Llama 2|7B|33.29|**21.25**|\\n|Llama 2|13B|41.86|26.10|\\n|Llama 2|70B|**50.18**|24.60|\\n\\n**Evaluation of pretrained LLMs on automatic safety benchmarks.** For TruthfulQA, we present the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher the better).

Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\\n\\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at [https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/)\\n'"
